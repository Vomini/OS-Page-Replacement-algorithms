> ❏ **Introduction:**
>
> Through this website, we aim that the people who visit it learn about
> page replacement algorithms, an integral part of the Operating Systems
> subject. We have taken care of both the theoretical and practical
> aspects of the topic. In theory, we have explained the basic idea and
> concept of the algorithms in a very understandable and lucid language.
> The theory pages are static pages mainly implemented using HTML5 and
> CSS3 for styling. The layout and design are kept very elegant and
> simple for better viewing and easy navigation. The pages are
> responsive and can be opened on mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and
> computers without any problem. The home page of the website is the
> index.HTML5 file in our code folder. We have implemented 6 algorithms,
> namely First In First Out, Belady’s Anomaly, Optimal Page Replacement,
> Least Recently Used, Most Recently Used, and finally Random Page
> Replacement. It is further linked to the pages of the different
> algorithms that we have implemented. The pages for the algorithm too
> are mainly static pages implemented in HTML5 and CSS3. Each page
> contains the theory of the algorithm along with an example. Further,
> for the practical aspect of the concepts, we have provided a live
> simulation for the algorithms about which the document states in the
> later part. We have tried to simulate the environment of a lab for
> page replacement algorithms where you can put in different values and
> find out the answer for yourself. The algorithms are mainly
> implemented using HTML5 CSS3 as well as JavaScript for reactivity. All
> the images that we have used are kept in the images folder. All the
> HTML5 files for the algorithms implemented can be found by opening the
> Page Replacement Algorithms folder. The CSS styling files for each
> page are in CSS and CSS_1 folder. JavaScript files for different pages
> can be found in JS folders. We mainly have coded on VS Code and
> Sublime Text.

> ❏ **Technologies** **Used:**
> ● HTML5
> ● CSS3
> ● JavaScript 
> ● Bootstrap
>
> ❏ **Algorithms** **Implemented**: All the below mentioned algorithm
> pages are are static pages mainly implemented using HTML5 and CSS3 for
> styling:
>
> ➢ On clicking “First in First Out” algorithm from the home page you
> will be redirected to the First in First out algorithm page where you
> will be able to see the basic introduction and example of the
> algorithm.
>
> ➢ On clicking “Least Recently Used” algorithm from the home page you
> will be redirected to the Least Recently Used algorithm page where you
> will be able to see the basic introduction and example of the
> algorithm.
>
> ➢ On clicking “Most Recently Used” algorithm from the home page you
> will be redirected to the Most Recently Used algorithm page where you
> will be able to see the basic introduction and example of the
> algorithm.
>
> ➢ On clicking “Optimal Page Replacement” algorithm from the home page
> you will be redirected to the Optimal Page Replacement algorithm page
> where you will be able to see the basic introduction and example of
> this algorithm.
>
> ➢ On clicking “Random Page Replacement” algorithm from the home page
> you will be redirected to the Random Page Replacement algorithm page
> where you will be able to see the basic introduction and example of
> the algorithm.
>
> On clicking the Live Simulation from the home page you will be
> redirected to the live simulation page. In the live simulation,the
> algorithms have been implemented using HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript.Once
> you open the live simulation page,you will be able to implement all
> the page replacement algorithms one at a time or all at once too as
> per your wish. You will have to follow the below mentioned steps:
>
> ● Firstly,you will have to enter the page data.We have also kept an
> option to generate random page data.
>
> ● You can change the minimum and maximum page length and the buffer
> size.
>
> ● By clicking on the algorithm you want to execute,you will be able to
> see the step by step implementation of the algorithm,number of page
> faults and the execution time.
>
> ● We have also provided the graphical representation of the algorithm
> where you will be able to see the graph between the number of page
> faults and the particular algorithm. You will also be able to compare
> two or more than two algorithms through this graphical representation.
